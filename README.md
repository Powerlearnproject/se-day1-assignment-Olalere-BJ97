Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Answer:
Here's an example of a vague prompt:

"Write a story about something interesting."

This prompt is vague because:

1. Lack of specificity: What constitutes "something interesting"? Is it a person, place, event, or idea?
2. Unclear genre: Is the story supposed to be fiction, non-fiction, sci-fi, fantasy, or something else?
3. No clear tone or style: Should the story be humorous, serious, adventurous, or romantic?
4. No word count or format guidelines: How long should the story be? Should it be a short story, a novel, or something in between?

A more specific and well-designed prompt might be:

"Write a 500-word science fiction short story about a character who discovers a hidden planet. Include a descriptive passage about the planet's unique landscape and a plot twist that challenges the character's initial assumptions."

This revised prompt provides clear guidelines and specificity, making it easier for the AI model to generate a relevant and engaging story.
